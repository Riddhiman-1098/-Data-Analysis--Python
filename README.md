Weather Data Analysis
Introduction
This project involves the analysis of weather data collected from the Jena region. The dataset, WeatherJena.csv, contains various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and CO2 concentration. The analysis includes data cleansing, exploration, and predictive modeling for temperature and rainfall.

Dataset
The dataset, WeatherJena.csv, is imported and analyzed using Python's pandas library. It is then subjected to various analyses to understand its structure, features, and any potential issues such as missing values, outliers, or duplicates.

Analysis Steps
Data Inspection: The dataset is inspected to understand its structure and features. Data types of each column are checked, and missing values, outliers, and duplicates are identified.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are addressed based on their impact on the analysis. Strategies such as imputation or removal are applied as needed.

Dealing with Duplicates: Duplicate rows are removed to ensure the dataset contains only unique records.

Humidity Analysis: The relationship between temperature and relative humidity is analyzed to identify patterns or trends. Predictive models for humidity levels based on temperature may also be developed.

Dew Point Analysis: The relationship between dew point temperature and relative humidity is investigated to assess moisture levels in the air and potential for condensation or fog.

Weather Pattern Identification: Wind direction and speed are analyzed, and visualized using a compass rose plot. Atmospheric pressure patterns are also studied using techniques such as moving averages or Fourier transform.

CO2 Analysis: Trends in CO2 concentration over time are visualized, and correlations with other variables such as temperature and humidity are explored.

Time Series Analysis: Time series plots are created for each variable to analyze trends, seasonal patterns, and identify any anomalies or outliers.

Temperature Prediction: Using historical temperature data, predictive models are built to forecast future temperatures. Techniques such as linear regression, ARIMA, or machine learning algorithms such as random forests or neural networks may be applied.

Rainfall Prediction: Predictive models are built using historical rainfall data. Techniques such as regression, time series forecasting, or machine learning algorithms are employed.
